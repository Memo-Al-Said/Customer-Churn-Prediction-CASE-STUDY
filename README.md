# Customer Churn Prediction CASE STUDY 1 
NOTE: Incase the jupyter notebook given does not function due to file path (churn.csv) not working

This is a solution to a case study related to data science. The case study involves developing a customer churn prediction model using a machine learning algorithm and data science principles.

Churn rate is an important indicator for subscription-based companies, granting the ability to detect customers who aren't satisfied with the provided services. This allows businesses to learn more about product or pricing weak points, operation issues, and customer preferences and expectations, while also helping to reduce reasons for churning proactively.

The objective of this case study was to build and design a churn prediction model that covers the basic scope of building a machine learning application to forecast customer churning towards a business service. The solution to the case study covers the following steps:

1) Data Overview and Cleaning: The selected dataset for the case study is inspected and cleaned before continueing the next step. This is done to get a general idea of what the dataset is like and how it should be handled later on.

2) Exploratory Data Analysis: Here, the selected dataset is analyzed deeply to reveal what are the factors leading to increase customer churn rates and by how much do they contribute to the churn rate.

3) Feature Engineering: After a thorough analysis of the selected data, the data receives transformations so that it is in a format that does not hinder the performance of the prediction model made afterwards. The transformed data also has a chance of improving the prediction model accuracy if there are any key features available that can help with model training. 

4) Model Training, testing, and evaluation: This step covers the development and performance validation of the customers' churn prediction models with various machine learning algorithms. Evaluations are also made to see which machine learning algorithms are best suited for the final prediction model before proper use.

5) Interpretation: The final conclusion about the case study solution and model performance is mentioned in this step. It also provides actionable insights with as much detail as possible.
